/**

 *      If both WiFi and power are connected, this receiver checks for completed traffic log files and uploads these by starting a {@link FileUploadService}.

 *      This implementation of {@link WifiAndPowerConnectivityReceiver} is intended for passive use, i.e. declaring the receiver in the manifest.
 *      By registering the receiver in the manifest, traffic log file uploads can be triggered even when this application is not active/running.
