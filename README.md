### How it works:

  Your device downloads the current model, improves it by learning from data on your phone, and then summarizes the changes as a small focused update. Only this update to the model is sent to the cloud( I used Google Cloud <img src="https://www.gstatic.com/devrel-devsite/prod/ve312520032ba2ac0c4d23f7b46fc670cbbe051886a2d1f04563a5e4768ad9787/cloud/images/cloud-logo.svg" width="60">but other could be used), where it is immediately averaged with other user updates to improve the shared model. All the training data remains on your device, and no individual updates are stored in the cloud.
